# BlackJack

Welcome to my Black Jack project! I built a simulation of the card game using python. The simulation is of a heavily simplified version of the game.

# Known Issues

* If hand is >21 and there are multiple aces in the hand only 1 will count as 1, the correct behavior would be to keep coutning aces as 1 until hand total is below 21
* The script cannot handle the deck object running out of cards mid-game
